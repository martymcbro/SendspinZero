# Minimalistic Sendspin Media Player for ESPHome / Home Assistant

A tiny Sendspin media player with **cover art display** and a **weather clock**, built around the **ESP32-S3 Zero**.

This project turns a small, inexpensive ESP32 board into a compact **audio receiver** for your amplifier, with a screen for album art, Song, Artist, and a weather clock when not playing.

## About the Project

This started as a fun experiment: I wanted to see if the little **ESP32-S3 Zero** would work with Sendspin. Since it has **2 MB of PSRAM**, I figured it *might* be possible—and it turns out, it is.

Once that worked, it hit me: instead of building yet another “Sendspin speaker”, why not make a **tiny receiver** for my amplifier?

So I:

* Replaced the **MAX98357** with a **PCM5102A DAC**
* Designed a custom case
* Added a display for **cover art** and a **weather clock**

…and this is the result 🙂

## Diagram & Pins Used

### If you plan to put it in the box, do not solder pins to the DAC, zero and display, solder cords directly to boards or they won't fit.
### I reused the display from breadboard that had pins soldered on so had to bend 2 legs to make space for the jack.

## Pin Mapping

### ESP32-S3 → PCM5102A

| ESP32-S3 GPIO | PCM5102A Pin |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| GPIO4         | LRCK         |
| GPIO5         | BCK          |
| GPIO6         | DIN          |

### ESP32-S3 → Display

| ESP32-S3 GPIO | Display Pin |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| GPIO7         | SCL         |
| GPIO8         | SDA         |
| GPIO9         | RST         |
| GPIO10        | DC          |
| GPIO11        | BL          |

### Power (Both Modules, make two split cables)

* **GND**
* **3.3V**

### And remember to solder the pads as on the on the back of the PCM5102A like in this image. and on the front, solder the bridge by SCK (some comes soldered, others unsoldered):

## Added Toslink (optical audio) version.

Toslink version without display, this is about the easiest project to make! and for under §10 :)

Your Soundbar will love you for it ;) - 3D files for case is in [3D_Files](3D_Files)

## Pin Mapping (even easier)

### ESP32-S3 → toslink connector

| ESP32-S3 GPIO | PCM5102A Pin |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| GPIO4         | VIN (DATA)   |
| 3.3V          | VCC          |
| GND           | GND          |

Pins on this specific toslink plug:
